Manubulon SNMP Plugins
======================

This is an unofficial cvs2git import from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/nagios-snmp/develop
with own and collected patches applied.

The original documentation and sourcecode is located at
http://nagios.manubulon.com

The support tracker is still located at sf.net
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=134917
but you may head over to http://www.monitoring-portal.org
for questions and feedback as well (rich community portal).

NOTE: If you're missing utils.pm, either install the
nagios-plugins-common debian package or copy plugins/utils.pm
to your perl lib path, or the one included like
use lib "/usr/local/icinga/libexec";
